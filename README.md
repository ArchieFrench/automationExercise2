## Running the tests under Maven

The template project comes with both Maven and Gradle build scripts. To run the tests with Maven, open a command window and run:

  ./mvnw clean verify

## Use Gradle

For GRADLE, pen a command window and run:

  ./gradlew test 

## Viewing the reports

Both of the commands provided above will produce a Serenity test report in the `target/site/serenity` directory. Go take a look!

## Test Case Progress and Project Overview  

### üìå Overview  
This project implements an automated testing framework using **Serenity BDD**, **JUnit 5**, and **Selenium WebDriver**. The aim is to ensure reliable end-to-end regression coverage, beginning with core user flows.  

---

### üñ•Ô∏è System Under Test  
The system under test is a **web-based eCommerce application** where users can browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and proceed through the checkout process.  

---

### üë©‚Äçüíª Example User Journey  

**Manual Flow:**  
1. User logs into the application.  
2. Browses product categories.  
3. Adds a selected product to the cart.  
4. Proceeds to checkout.  
5. Confirms order.  

**Automated Flow (via Selenium + Serenity):**  
- Navigation, login, and product selection are automated.  
- Adding items to the cart is partially automated (TC12).  
- Checkout validation steps are in progress.

## üêû Defects & Suggested Actions

### 1. Unconventional Signup Flow
<img width="695" height="403" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c76e3311-6ee1-4deb-90d7-ad793c2a35db" />


**Description:**  
Unlike standard signup forms that present fields like **Email**, **Password**, and **Confirm Password** on a single page, this application uses a two-step process:

- **Step 1:** The user enters only **Name** and **Email**.
- **Step 2:** The user is taken to a new page to provide more information such as **Password**, **Title**, **Date of Birth**, and other account details.

**Why this is a defect:**  
- It deviates from standard user experience expectations for registration.  
- Users may be confused or drop off due to the unexpected redirection.  
- Automation scripts that assume a single-page form may break.  
- Page transitions require additional handling in test automation to ensure all fields are validated properly across both steps.

**Suggested Action:**  
- Treat this as a **multi-step form** in testing documentation and scripts.  
- Ensure test cases and automation flows are updated to verify each stage separately and confirm that data passes correctly from step 1 to step 2.

### 2. Country-State-City Mismatch Validation Issue
<img width="761" height="380" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abdffeb8-9bd5-41c0-adf4-13b812ba30b9" />

**Description:**  
During registration, the user is allowed to select **India** as the country but still enter any other city, for example, **Glasgow** (a UK city) as the city. The form does not trigger any validation error or warning.

**Why this is a defect:**  
- Leads to **logically inconsistent data** in the system.  
- Breaks basic **geographic integrity rules**‚Äîa user should not be able to pair mismatched country and city combinations.  
- Could negatively impact downstream systems (e.g., shipping, reporting, or region-specific features).  
- Indicates a **lack of contextual validation** on the front end or back end.

**Suggested Action:**  
- Implement country-city validation rules to prevent incompatible combinations.  
- Add **negative test cases** to the automation suite that attempt invalid city-country pairings and expect proper error handling.

### 3. Button Blocked by Advertisement Pop-Up
**Description:**
On the product listing page, a persistent advertisement banner appears at the bottom of the screen. This banner occasionally obstructs the ‚ÄúAdd to cart‚Äù button, making it unclickable during automated test execution.

**Why this is a defect:**
- Prevents reliable access to critical UI elements, such as the "Add to cart" button.
- Interferes with test automation flows, causing failures unrelated to the actual application logic.
- Introduces false negatives in test reports, increasing debugging time.
- Results in inconsistent test outcomes depending on ad timing and page load speed.

**Suggested Action:**
- Implement a scroll-to-element action before attempting to click buttons that may be blocked.
- Where possible, add logic to detect and dismiss pop-up ads or adjust viewport/window size in tests.
- Capture and document such cases with screenshots for test reporting and potential stakeholder review.

### üèóÔ∏è Framework Overview  
- **Serenity BDD**: Generates living documentation with rich test reports.  
- **JUnit 5**: Provides modern test lifecycle management.  
- **Selenium WebDriver**: Handles UI automation for web interactions.  
- **Maven/Gradle Support**: Flexible build and execution support.  

---

### üìÇ Project Organisation  
- **Dependency Mapping**: Test cases were broken down into dependencies using a **topological sort**, ensuring execution order was logical and efficient.  
- **Project Board (Trello)**: Used to visualise progress and manage test case assignments.  
- **Pair Work**: We split into pairs and each implemented a test case.  
- **Branching Strategy**: Each pair uploaded their test cases to **respective feature branches**, which were later merged into the **main master branch** after review.  
- **Merge Conflicts**: Addressed collaboratively to ensure a clean integration of all completed test cases.  
- **README**: Provides setup instructions, execution commands, and reporting guide.  
- **Test Approach**: Prioritised automating high-impact user flows first (login, search, add-to-cart).  

---

### üîÑ Retrospective / Lessons Learned  
- Starting with **one framework (Selenium)** would have reduced complexity before moving to Serenity and Cucumber.  
- Using a **topological sort** gave structure to test case dependencies.  
- **Pair programming** improved accuracy and productivity.  
- The **branching and merging workflow** provided hands-on experience with version control and resolving conflicts.  
- A **Trello board** helped track progress, blockers, and priorities effectively.
